[과제01] EM Algorithm: Binomial Mixture

 강의노트 Likelihood의 13-16쪽의 Example, Exercise.

 Generate a random sample (complete data) from a Binomial mixture distribution with parameters (theta1, theta2). Set the parameter values and the sample size as you wish. You may repeat experiments with several different parameter settings.
Compute MLE with the "complete" data. You know the class label (Z) and the feature value (Y).
Suppose that you don't know the class label. Implement EM algorithm for the "incomplete" data.
Compute MLE for (theta1, theta2)
Compute resposibilities. Plot responsiblity against Y.
 Compute log-likelihoods for each iteration and plot loglik against iteration.
Write the estimated likelihood function. Plot the pdf.
